Assignment 1	-- This assignment was to compare results obtained by a decision tree algorithm and a nearest neighbors algorithm.


The program runs the data through weka and produces plots.
These plots are also saved in this folder.
The program depends on matplotlib and requires that the data files be kept in a file called data.

To run, simply enter
python run_exp.py

Make sure that weka is in your path variable
This program is designed to run linux

This program uses its own arff reader implemented in the class arff_file()
