3.1) Based on the graph we can see that nearest neighbors is highly affected (detrimentally) by irrelevent features, where the decision tree algorithm is not greatly affected.

3.2) Based on the graph, increasing the size of the training set generally increases accuracy except for nearest neighbors when there is a large number of irrelevent features.
